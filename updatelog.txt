[UPDATE] 09-07-2017

Delete me when there is a proper first entry, but it seemed like something
needed to be here. lol great keeping it!

[UPDATE] 09-07-2017

Robots:
  -Pris' eMMC can't find the kernel (u-boot happens, serial terminal gives the Exynos's terminal)
  -Zhora's currently using Arch (we don't have another Zhora)
  -Deckard's Kinect does not turn on (when kinect is connected to odroid, no red light (or green light))
  -Roy Great :)
Tasks: (with suggested priorities)
  1) Rerun experiment (U3's haven't crashed through connection lately)
    once a crash happens, let's do a yes test and look for a consistent crash and take data
  2) Make an XU4 image (the one's I've made do not end up even booting when connected)
  
New Materials:
  1) USB to eMMC
  2) More eMMC chips would be awesome
  
Comments:
I'm down to work on whatever you see as our best option/fix!

[UPDATE] 09-12-2017

Testing:
  - Successful stress testing on Odroid U3 while it was powered by a powered hub.
  - Crashes when connected to battery power. Then netiher config would crash at all.

Testing plan for TH:
  - Attempt to run experiment
  - Once space is occupied, attempt to create Odroid XU4 image
  - Next, attempt to connect to Deckard's kinect via computer

Misc:
  - The odroid battery packs have two USB ports which output different amounts of
    current. One port does 1.5A, the other 2.1A. They are designated by one or
    two lightning bolts.
